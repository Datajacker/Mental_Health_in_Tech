# Mental Health In Tech
The repository concerns the Mental Health in Tech analysis, which takes data from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. This is also a record for one interview case.
* One post about this project has been shared on [medium](https://jyi3.medium.com/cluster-from-people-in-the-tech-industry-survey-4a33edf05f8a)

* The steps of the data science process: **Data cleaning, Exploratory analysis, Feature Engineering, Clustering, Cluster interpretation, Conclusion**

## Installation
This project analyzes the dataset and builds the model to segment different behavior groups.

## Project motivation

Mental illness, also called mental health disorders, refers to a wide range of mental health conditions — disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors.

People may have mental health conditions time to time. However, a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function.

With the Covid-19 situation and remote-work setting, mental health issues become more critical among people who work in the Tech. Better mental health can increase the overall productivity of employees and make them live a happier life. Therefore, this project tries to explore the behivor of different groups and find solutions to improve their mental health condition.
